CSU CS540 Team I project

This can be the hosting location for our code.  The best way to update existing code is to create a new branch, make the edits and then create a "pull request" to merge the branch with the master version.  Theoretically, this will allow us to traceback an issue if someone accidentally overwrites functionality.
